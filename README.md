I struggle with misophonia, and this is by far the most effective sound masker I have found or designed.  Of particular note, it's very possible to listen to media, including voice and music, while the masker is playing at a fairly high volume.  Note that I am not a hearing expert; I do not know that the generated tone is safe for the human ear, and it seems to carry somewhat effectively into adjacent rooms.
